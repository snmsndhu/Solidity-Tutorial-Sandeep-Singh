# Lets Dive into the ERC721 Token

## Which is basically a NFT.

### NFT is a Non Fungible Token.

Lets dive into the code.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifer:MIT;

pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
contract NFT is ERC721{
constructor() ERC721("NFT", "NFT")
_mint(msg.sender, 1)
}
```

1. So, basically its pretty straight forward to make the **NFT** using **Solidity**.
2. Its only 5 line of code, but without any functionallity in it.
3. So, First 3 lines are same as **ERC20** token, after that

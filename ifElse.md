# If/Else in **Solidity** are same same as the other Programing Languages.

If you have previous **Experience** in **Programing**, then it's pretty much same as other **Language**.

So, Let's dive into coding.

```solidity
//SPDX-Licence-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract IfElse {
    function IfElse(uint x) public pure returns (uint) {
        if(i < 5){
            continue;
        }
        if(1 < 10){
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

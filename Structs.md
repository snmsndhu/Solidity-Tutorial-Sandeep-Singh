# Structs allows us to create our own Data types.

## We can give them different properties, according to our needs and requirements.

For better **Understanding** let's have a look on an example.

```solidity
//SPDX-Licence-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

contract Structs {
Struct Register(
    string name;
    uint age;
    address text;
)
}
```
